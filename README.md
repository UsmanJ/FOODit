=============

## Getting started

1. Install Node.js and Bower dependencies.

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. Run `grunt serve` to serve up your files using a local Node (Connect) server. A browser window will open pointing to your `index.html` file. Any changes you make will be reflected in the browser immediately (without you having to hit refresh all the time). You will also get feedback about JSHint issues and test results in the terminal as you go along.
